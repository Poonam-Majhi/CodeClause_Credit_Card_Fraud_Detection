# CodeClause_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
In this project, we solve the problem of detecting credit card fraud transactions using machine numpy, scikit learn, and few other python libraries. We overcome the problem by creating a binary classifier and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to see which fits better.
# Datasets
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.
# Steps for developing this model:
1. Analysis the data.
2. Applied various algorithms like Reggression, Decision Tree,etc.
3. Finally the algorithms which have more accuracy is predicted to be great model.
